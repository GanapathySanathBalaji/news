 A post-graduate sharing session was organized by the NUS IEEE-HKN student chapter and took place on the 21st of November, 2019. During the session, Ms. Qiu Yihui and Mr. Dong Bowei shared about the value of PhD, their personal journey and reasons for doing a PhD. They also talked about what they do in a day as a PhD Student and how it was different from an undergraduate student. The event gave our senior undergraduate students the opportunity to explore their suitability for an academic research career and discover how a PhD can catapult them ahead in such a career.
