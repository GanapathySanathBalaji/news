&emsp;In the lead-up to the new academic year, NUS IEEE-HKN conducted the inaugural online Alumni Networking and Sharing session, attended by 9 current undergraduates and 4 alumni members. In this session, we welcomed back IEEE-HKN alumni members to share their experiences with current members of the Lambda Omega chapter, including Daryl, who provided tips on job-searching, Chen Si, who highlighted the relevance of his experiences in university to his career and Shuli, who shared about her graduate studies experiences abroad.

&emsp;The session also consisted of a networking section, where each of the student members could more informally talk to the alumni present. Though limited by the online setting, the event ended up being a fruitful and enjoyable experience for the attendees. We are grateful to the alumni members who took time out of their busy schedules to attend the session, and hope our members have learnt something new from the event.
