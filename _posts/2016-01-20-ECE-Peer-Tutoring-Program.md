NUS IEEE-HKN Chapter and NUS ECE Department initiated the NUS ECE Peer Tutoring Scheme in August 2015. Academically
stronger students are invited to assist in guiding other students in their foundation modules in ECE. This was
established to provide a learning support for the academically challenged students.


The purpose of a peer tutor is to provide students facing trouble with a particular module with another avenue to seek
help from because students may not be comfortable contacting the professors, lecturers and TAs when in doubt. Emphasis
is placed on ensuring that all students have the opportunity to receive one-on-one support to achieve success in school
and reach their academic goals.
